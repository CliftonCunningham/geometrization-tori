Here is my brief report
"A function-sheaf dictionary for algebraic toriÂ over local fields"
Clifton Cunningham and David Roe.

In their paper the authors are trying to develop a theory of what they
call quasicharacter sheaves on commutative group schemes. The theory
is nice, so it would be good to have it in a published form.

On the other hand, the results seem to be rather straightforward, and
no application of the theory is given.

Therefore I don't think that the paper meets the standards of
originality and quality of Compositio Mathematica.
